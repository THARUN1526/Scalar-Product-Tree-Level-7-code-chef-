In simple words, the code is solving a problem related to a tree data structure. The tree consists of nodes, and each node has a value associated with it. The code performs two types of queries:

1. Find Query: Given two nodes in the tree, it finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the values along the unique path between those nodes.
2. Change Query: Given two nodes and an increment value, it adds the increment value to the values along the unique path between those nodes.

To solve the problem, the code uses a depth-first traversal of the tree to calculate values for each node based on its parent's value. It stores these calculated values in a list. Then, for each query, it traverses the paths from the given nodes to their common ancestor and calculates the desired result based on the values of the nodes on the path.

The code uses a combination of dictionaries and lists to represent the tree and perform the necessary calculations. It also applies modular arithmetic to keep the calculated values within a specific range.

Overall, the code efficiently processes the queries by precalculating values using dynamic programming and then using them to answer the queries on demand.
